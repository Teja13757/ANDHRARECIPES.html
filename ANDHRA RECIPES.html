                <p class="w3-text-grey">Ingredients:
1 cup rice flour,1 cup powdered sugar,1/2 cup ghee (clarified butter),A pinch of cardamom powder,A pinch of edible camphor (optional, for flavor),A pinch of salt,1/2 cup water
Instructions:
Preparing the Rice Flour:Start by making rice flour. You can use store-bought rice flour, but for the best results, you can make it at home by grinding rice. Use regular raw rice (not parboiled) and grind it into a fine powder. Sift the rice flour to remove any coarse particles.
Making the Dough:Heat 1/2 cup of water in a pan and add a pinch of salt to it.Gradually add the rice flour to the hot water while stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Keep stirring until it forms a smooth, soft, and non-sticky dough. This dough is called "Pindi."Remove the dough from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.Rolling the Layers:Once the Pindi has cooled, take a small portion of the dough and roll it into a small, smooth ball.Place the ball on a clean, smooth surface (like a greased banana leaf, parchment paper, or a greased plate). You can also use a plastic sheet for this purpose.Press the ball of dough gently and start spreading it as thin as possible with your fingers. You need to create an incredibly thin and even layer.
Assembling Putharekulu:Once you have created a thin layer, sprinkle a little powdered sugar, a pinch of cardamom powder, and a pinch of edible camphor (if using) evenly over it.Heat ghee until it's hot but not smoking. Carefully drizzle a few drops of hot ghee over the layer, ensuring it's evenly distributed.Place another thin layer of dough on top of the first layer, repeating the same process of spreading, adding sugar and spices, and drizzling ghee.Continue this process until you've used up all the dough.
Serving Putharekulu:Once you've assembled all the layers, allow the Putharekulu to cool and set for a few hours.Once it has set, carefully peel the layers from the base.Serve the Putharekulu as a delicious and delicate sweet treat.Putharekulu is a labor-intensive sweet to make, but it's worth the effort for its unique taste and texture. It's a special treat often made during festivals and celebrations in Andhra Pradesh.</p><br>
